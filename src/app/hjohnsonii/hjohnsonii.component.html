        Seagrasses are marine flowering plants that live entirely underwater. They reproduce both asexually and
        sexually,
        growing by rhizome extension. Seagrass meadows are globally distributed in areas with high light levels and
        clear
        water, within intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. Due to their light constraints, growth is restricted to the
        photic zone and is not possible in deeper waters. Seagrasses are ecological engineers, altering the environment
        by
        changing the water flow, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, and providing refuge for benthic organisms.
        In
        recent decades, global seagrasses have dramatically declined in density, extent, and biodiversity. Multiple
        stressors have directly contributed to these declines, including climate changes, shifts in water quality, and
        increased contaminants entering coastal waters. Conducting studies on why seagrass populations are declining can
        be complex, time consuming, and costly. Designing a simulation model with data collected from field and lab
        experiments allows us to mimic realistic environmental changes and predict their impacts on a model organism.
        Models can predict how populations should react based on stochastic stimuli such as the intensity of light
        reaching seagrasses. Individual-based models (IBMs) are used to predict population-level impacts by modeling how
        individuals react to abiotic and biotic conditions in their local environment in terms of their survival,
        growth,
        and reproduction, each resulting from the individuals’ unique behavior, genetics, and experiences. Halophila
        johnsonii is a rare threatened seagrass located on a 200km stretch of Atlantic Floridian coast. This species has
        relatively low biomass, a high turnover rate, and is tolerant to fluctuations in temperature and salinity. We
        constructed an IBM to predict how H. johnsonii should be impacted by a variety of light conditions that resemble
        natural and anthropogenically-driven reductions in light levels. The model predicts that seagrass patches will
        decrease in density and extent when exposed to more severe and/or more frequent light reduction. This suggests
        that without improvements in water quality, H. johnsonii’s density and distribution should decrease. While this
        species is relatively small-bodied, it provides ecosystem services in shallower waters than many species are
        able
        to inhabit, increasing concerns about the impacts of its decline.

        The Model
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div>
        <p>
          The java implementation of this model was written at Rowan University by Vincent Scavetta under the
          supervision
          of Dr. Courtney Richmond. The code was initially written in FORTRAN 90 by Dr. Richmond in conjunction with Dr.
          Rose. The model uses real growth data collected from field and lab based experiments on the seagrass H.
          johnsonii. Solar data was collected from the NOAA database measured at Miami station #722030 (West Palm Beach
          Intl Arpt, FL). The raw solar data was transformed to produce a value relative to the maximum solar irradiance
          recorded. These transformed values were implemented into the mode to simulate typical irradiance values
          throughout a given year.
        </p>

          In its current state, the model is very basic in its nature. There is currently only one variable for light
          reduction that is adjusted throughout the course of the simulation. By the end of this project, we hope to
          have
          a more realistic simulation that takes into account the following items:

              These figures show that as storm frequency decreases the population size remains more stable. Also the
              deeper the seagrass live, the less effect the storms have. As storm frequency increases, the population

              The model follows this sequence of events. The model starts by initializing the startup parameters, output

              assign it for each cell, then simulate the population. After the simulation is finished, a final statistic
